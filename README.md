# p3-blog
All files found in the blog at https://professional-practical-programmer.com/ can be located in this repo.

Each blog entry has its own subdirectory which is a fully functional gradle project. In each entry the gradle wrapper files have been committed.

TO RUN: `git clone` the project. Move into the directory of your choice (each blog has its own directory), then use `./gradlew build` to build the project. It should build on Windows or Linux with no dependencies, not even Gradle! :)
